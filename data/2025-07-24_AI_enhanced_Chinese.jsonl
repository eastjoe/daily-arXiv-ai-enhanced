However,\nthe data required for a life cycle assessment (LCA) that maps the materials and\nprocesses from product manufacturing to disposal into environmental impacts\n(EI) are often unavailable. Here we reimagine conventional LCA by introducing\nmultimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and\nstakeholders like product managers and engineers to calculate the\ncradle-to-gate (production) carbon emissions of electronic devices. The AI\nagents iteratively generate a detailed life-cycle inventory leveraging a custom\ndata abstraction and software tools that extract information from online text\nand images from repair communities and government certifications. This approach\nreduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data\navailability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of\nexpert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to\ndirectly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with\nsimilar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop\nwith a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven\nmethod to generate emission factors. We use the properties of an unknown\nmaterial to represent it as a weighted sum of emission factors for similar\nmaterials. Compared to human experts picking the closest LCA database entry,\nthis improves MAPE by 120.26%. We analyze the data and compute scaling of this\napproach and discuss its implications for future LCA workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u52a0\u901f\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfLCA\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8LCA\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u62dfLCA\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u5177\u4ece\u5728\u7ebf\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff08EI\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6392\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u4e00\u5206\u949f\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u503c\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6LCA\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u572819%\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f30\u8ba1EI\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a12.28%\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u6392\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06MAPE\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86120.26%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u60f3\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08LCA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u4ee3\u7406\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4ece\u6447\u7bee\u5230\u5927\u95e8\uff08\u751f\u4ea7\uff09\u7684\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6392\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy\nconstraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we\npropose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical\nframework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is\ncomplete and bounded-suboptimal.

To strike a good balance between\nresponse quality and latency, we design a user query router that can\nintelligently choose between (i) FastTrack mode: to handle simple requests that\nonly need additional relevant context retrieved from knowledge corpora; and\n(ii) FullAgentic mode: to handle complicated requests that need composite\nactions and tool invocations to proactively discover context across various\ncompliance artifacts, and/or involving other APIs/models for accommodating\nrequests. A typical example would be to start with a user query, use its\ndescription to find a specific entity and then use the entity's information to\nquery other APIs for curating and enriching the final AI response.\n  Our experimental evaluations compared CBA against an out-of-the-box LLM on\nvarious real-world privacy/compliance-related queries targeting various\npersonas. We found that CBA substantially improved upon the vanilla LLM's\nperformance on metrics such as average keyword match rate (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and\nLLM-judge pass rate (82.0% vs. 20.0%). We also compared metrics for the full\nrouting-based design against the `fast-track only` and `full-agentic` modes and\nfound that it had a better average match-rate and pass-rate while keeping the\nrun-time approximately the same.

To address this, research communities often organise periodic\ncompetitions to evaluate the performance of various algorithms and techniques,\nthereby tracking advancements in the field. However, these competitions pose a\nsignificant operational burden. The organisers must manage and evaluate a large\nvolume of submissions. Furthermore, participants typically develop their\nsolutions in diverse environments, leading to compatibility issues during the\nevaluation of their submissions. This paper presents an online competition\nsystem that automates the submission and evaluation process for a competition.\nThe competition system allows organisers to manage large numbers of submissions\nefficiently, utilising isolated environments to evaluate submissions. This\nsystem has already been used successfully for several competitions, including\nthe Grid-Based Pathfinding Competition and the League of Robot Runners\ncompetition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5728\u7ebf\u7ade\u8d5b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ade\u8d5b\u63d0\u4ea4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7ade\u8d5b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u75db\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ade\u8d5b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u8fd0\u8425\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\u3001\u63d0\u4ea4\u7269\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u7ebf\u7ade\u8d5b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528\u9694\u79bb\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4ea4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ade\u8d5b\u63d0\u4ea4\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7ade\u8d5b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u63d0\u4ea4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ade\u8d5b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ade\u8d5b\u63d0\u4ea4\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7ade\u8d5b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u7ade\u8d5b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ade\u8d5b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u7684\u8bf8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
