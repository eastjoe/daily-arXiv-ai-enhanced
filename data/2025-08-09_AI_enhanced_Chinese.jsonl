This paper presents\nan integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for\nprescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to\nprovide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP\nframework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that\ncombines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for\nintelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration\ndata (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM\nprocessing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system\nclassifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and\nassesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance\nmanuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web\nsearches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date\nmaintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The\nGemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes\nimmediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts\nrequirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing\nvibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually\nrelevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between\ncondition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial\npractitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the\napplication of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework\nfor prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial\nsectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f74\u627f\u632f\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ef4\u62a4\u5efa\u8bae\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u68b0\u7ef4\u62a4\u9700\u8981\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6545\u969c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u8f74\u627f\u632f\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbfLLM\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u7ef4\u62a4\u624b\u518c\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u641c\u7d22\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u5b9e\u8df5\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0cGemini\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u8ba1\u5212\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u8f74\u627f\u632f\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u5206\u6790\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u68b0\u8fdb\u884c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u6545\u969c\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7acb\u5373\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u68c0\u67e5\u6e05\u5355\u3001\u7ea0\u6b63\u63aa\u65bd\u3001\u96f6\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u89c4\u8303\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

The evaluation is\nstructured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across\nplayers. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,\nmost LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater\nadaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans.

Our framework achieves\nsubstantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,\noutperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the\nmulti-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.", "AI": {"tldr": "QA-Dragon\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6539\u8fdb\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bVQA\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5355\u72ec\u68c0\u7d22\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u6700\u65b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001RAG\u7cfb\u7edfQA-Dragon\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u9886\u57df\u8def\u7531\u5668\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728Meta CRAG-MM\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e2d\uff0cQA-Dragon\u5728\u5355\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e865.06%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e866.35%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e865.03%\u3002", "conclusion": "QA-Dragon\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6e90\u3001\u591a\u6e90\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002"}}
