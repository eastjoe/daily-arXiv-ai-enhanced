GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies\nas nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution\nand dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a\nBrain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency\ngraphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval,\nanalysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware\ntoken management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed\narchitecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility\nenvironments.

To overcome this, we introduce\nBifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both\nlinguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure\n(via a Document Navigator Graph).

Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that\nBifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1\nscore of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and\ngraph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches.

Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload,\nOntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology\nby: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts\n(according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on\nthe existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to\nhide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics.\nOntView has been released with an open-source license for the whole community.", "AI": {"tldr": "OntView: \u4e00\u6b3e\u65b0\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f4\u89c2\u3001\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u652f\u6301GCIs\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u548c\u67e5\u770b\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5927\u578b\u672c\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u7406\u89e3\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528DL\u63a8\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u6240\u89c1\u5373\u6240\u5f97\u7684\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u89c6\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u521b\u5efa\u672c\u4f53\u6458\u8981\u3001\u5173\u6ce8\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7c7b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684TBox\u5143\u7d20\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u9690\u85cf/\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u652f\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86OntView \u672c\u4f53\u67e5\u770b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5f00\u6e90\u65b9\u5f0f\u53d1\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "OntView \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u89c2\u5730\u5c55\u793a\u672c\u4f53\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u5176\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u89c6\u56fe\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\u3002"}}

[Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge\ntransfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal\nrepresentations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the\nenvironment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive\nrecovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention\ninstantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect\ncorresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while\nincreasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative\nreward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent\nand is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by\nquerying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]\nOur findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were\nable to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully\nretrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of\ncausal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment\ncomplexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u78b0\u649e\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b8f\uff0c\u4f7fMARL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684MARL\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u624d\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u78b0\u649e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6062\u590d\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u5b8f\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u8d28\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u65f6\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u968f\u673a\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f02\u8d28\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7684\u969c\u788d\u7269\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper introduces an early-stage\nprototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary\nresults highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI\ncollaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u601d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684AI\u521b\u610f\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u590d\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u770b\u5230\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u521b\u9020\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u601d\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u901a\u7528\u5171\u540c\u6784\u601d\u8005\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u601d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfc\u822a\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u521b\u9020\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u624b\u5de5\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u683c\u5f0f\u548c\u521b\u9020\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, diagnosing AD remains a significant\nchallenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection\nbias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention\nframework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal\nIntervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language\nmodel (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining\nstructured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.\nThe ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)\nimages and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into\nCognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of\nconfounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,\nnon-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,\ngenerating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates\nconfounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the\noutstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,\nachieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics.
