While recent progress has\nfocused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,\nexplicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,\nlong-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents\ntrained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but\nstructurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces\nand sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved\nthrough hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into\nstructured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly\nconstruct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a\nparadigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this\nhierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model\non the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,\ndense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional\nlearning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors\nwith far greater sample efficiency.

In\nthis paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice\nAI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in\nthis paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying\nprocess generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our\nsystem listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic\nvoice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human\nagents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt\nengineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech\nrecognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech\nsynthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated\nagainst human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product\ncommunication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show\nthat the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call\nwhile underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these\nshortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly.

However, the following challenges still exist in prior\nmethods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive\nmechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference\nspeed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable\nof parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and\nsupport for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose\nSparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization\nprecision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are\nsimultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based\ndiscrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a\npre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token\nrouter and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations\ninherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token\ngeneration process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the\ninference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on\na modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model\nto identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.\nMoreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to\nsystematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across\ndiverse scenarios.

However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly\nrely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,\nthereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three\ncollaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by\nhistorical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key\nconditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of\ncritical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance\nthe efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage\noptimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,\nenabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,\ndemonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including\nself-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under\ncomparable inference budgets.
