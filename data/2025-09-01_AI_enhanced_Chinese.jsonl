By leveraging domain-approved\nconnections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical\nconcept representations by incorporating contextual information from related\nconcepts.

Consequently, concept\nrepresentation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,\noverlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a\nlarge language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework\nthat leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis\nknowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to\nenhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first\nemploys LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology\nconcept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept\ndescriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our\nmethod jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by\nperforming knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical\npropagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology\nhorizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of\nLINKO over state-of-the-art baselines.

This discrepancy highlights a\ncritical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and\nprocedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional\nreinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through\nenvironmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require\nsubstantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge\nand reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static\nknowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers\nLLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game\nenvironments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory\nabilities.

Forgetting has many\nfacets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a\nconditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing\nforgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable\nelimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to\nfocus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic\nprogramming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief\nrevision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical\ndeduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we\ntake an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic\nstates with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional\nlogic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic\nbackground means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to\nthe epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and\ninstantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking\nfunctions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic\nprogramming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating\nforgetting operations.

Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the\nstates are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the\natoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not\nfull STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the\nactions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different\nversions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the\ntraces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all\nobservable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as\nthe atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,\nand the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not\nthe ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the\nlearning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,\nwhere certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions\nwhich can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The\nlearning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+\nstate-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,\nconstructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or\n``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground\nthe implicit action arguments in STRIPS+.

Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are\nrigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,\nrequiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures\ndepend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent\nin wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both\nmultidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological\nscience and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z\nnumbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score\n(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,\nparticipants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral\ndilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which\nwere mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of\neach individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with\nmembership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In\na proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom\nrepresentations that correlated modestly but significantly with established\nscales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting\nconvergent and divergent validity.

In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of\ncounterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that\nmust satisfy $\\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of\ngenerating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are\nallowed on $P$.

The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,\nRESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,\nconfiguration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates\nhow the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing\ncosts, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating\nprivate LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural\nnetworks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time\ndecision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f25\u5408\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u4e1a\u52a1\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7406\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528AI\u4ee3\u7406\u3001RESTful APIs\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u9632\u6b62\u7f3a\u8d27\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7ef4\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\u6765\u6539\u5584\u89c4\u5212\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u79c1\u6709LLM\u3001\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}
