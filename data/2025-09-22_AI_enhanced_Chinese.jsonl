However, this same capability introduces\na critical risk of what we term knowledge-driven hallucination: a phenomenon\nwhere the model's output contradicts explicit source evidence because it is\noverridden by the model's generalized internal knowledge. This paper\ninvestigates this phenomenon by evaluating LLMs on the task of automated\nprocess modeling, where the goal is to generate a formal business process model\nfrom a given source artifact. The domain of Business Process Management (BPM)\nprovides an ideal context for this study, as many core business processes\nfollow standardized patterns, making it likely that LLMs possess strong\npre-trained schemas for them. We conduct a controlled experiment designed to\ncreate scenarios with deliberate conflict between provided evidence and the\nLLM's background knowledge. We use inputs describing both standard and\ndeliberately atypical process structures to measure the LLM's fidelity to the\nprovided evidence.

Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its\nmisaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires\ndifferent strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our\nmitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal\npreviously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after\nadditional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often\ndemonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal\nevidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness\nincreases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in\ncovert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.\nWhile we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational\nawareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to\nrely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard\nEnglish.

Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the\ninfection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were\nretrospectively analyzed.
