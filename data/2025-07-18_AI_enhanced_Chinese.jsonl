Despite this advancement,\ncurrent AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive\nnature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or\nincorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is\nmost apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain\nunderdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring\nsystems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,\nindividualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel\nmulti-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized\nfeedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to\nenable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students\nto learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise\nfor exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized\nexercises.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The\nmulti-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby\nproblems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights\nduring aggregation.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24.

The study employed Multiple Linear Regression\n(MLR) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, analyzing data collection intervals\nranging from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. Using R^2, MAE, and RMSE as performance\nmetrics, the analysis revealed that both MLR and RF models performed optimally\nwith 10-minute data collection intervals. These findings are expected to\ncontribute to future traffic congestion solutions and efficient traffic\nmanagement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c10\u5206\u949f\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u9694\uff0cMLR\u548cRF\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u7403\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u91cd\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52(MLR)\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797(RF)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u95f4\u9694(30\u79d2\u523015\u5206\u949f)\u7684\u52a0\u5dde78\u53f7\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "MLR\u548cRF\u6a21\u578b\u572810\u5206\u949f\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u95f4\u9694\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u91cd\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u5dde78\u53f7\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f7f\u752810\u5206\u949f\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u95f4\u9694\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u3002"}}

However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two\nkey limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial\nconstruction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and\n(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution\nstrategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic\nreinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms\ntree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally\nconstructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while\nlearning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or\naggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving\nboth solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion\nand focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for\ntreestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic\nframeworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u52a8\u6001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6539\u8fdb\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0cProbTree\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u6811\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u52a8\u6001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u589e\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u63a8\u7406\u6811\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u65f6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ProbTree\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u6811\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
