However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive\ncomputation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient\nreasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token\nbudgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and\nreliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify\nthat encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to\nits solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise\nreward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of\nintermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and\nnaturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and\nAIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our\nmethod achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original\nreasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and\naccuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before\nand after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively\nsuppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally\nalleviating the overthinking problem.

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved\ntowards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level\nsummaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,\nunaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected\n``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community\nreasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often\ndegenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's\nrich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated\nwith path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.\nExtensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains\ndemonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in\nresponse quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

However,\nreal-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of\nrarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully\ncapture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on\nlongitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical\nperformance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,\nlargely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address\nthese issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for\nRobust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two\ncomplementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated\nmedical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from\nreal-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which\nnaturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer\nthrough shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.\nTo further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse\nregularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing\nspurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model\nachieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and\nmaintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings.
