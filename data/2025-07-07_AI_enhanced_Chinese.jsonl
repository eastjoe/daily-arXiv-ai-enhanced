While AI agents\noffer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,\nlimiting their ability to adapt and scale.

STELLA employs a\nmulti-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities\nthrough two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning\nstrategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent\nautomatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows\nSTELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring\napproximately 26\\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\\% on LAB-Bench:\nDBQA, and 63\\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6\npercentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance\nsystematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the\nHumanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials.

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data\nfrom audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and\nevaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases\nwhere the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across\nclasses appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has\nroughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately.

To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully\nautomated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in\nnatural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -\nand rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate\nNL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the\nautomated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,\ninstruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models\nachieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal\nplans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis\nshows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is\ncontingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the\nhighest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON\nrepresentation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid\nplan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task\n- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade\nperformance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from\nnatural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex\nproblems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will\ninevitably shift.

While recent frameworks simulate\nmedical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor\nagent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world\ndiagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.\nIn this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the\nMIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,\npatient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel\ndynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,\ninteractive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the\npatient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its\ncomposition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of\nDynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for\ndynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDynamiCare\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86MIMIC-Patient\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DynamiCare\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DynamiCare\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "DynamiCare\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}
