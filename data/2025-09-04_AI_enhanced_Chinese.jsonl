Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based\nrepresentations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM\ncomponents a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite\npromising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are\ntruly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive\nevaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,\npre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time\ncomputation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.\nThrough extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate\nthat, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve\nperformance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify\nwhich techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons\nfor the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for\nautonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and\nachieve competitive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Waymo Sim Agents\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2aLLM\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3001\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Waymo Sim Agents\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u9002\u5f53\u8c03\u6574\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u6280\u672f\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "conclusion": "\u90e8\u5206LLM\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u3002"}}

Therefore, accountability\nbecomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory\nbodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and\nfocus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a\nknowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term\naccountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on\nthe actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI\naccountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges\nthe gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for\nAI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of\naccountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a\nthree-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our\naccountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and\nthe mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.\nMoreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI\nsystem to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our\nframework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared\ndependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should\nfoster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating\ncommunication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate\nthe collaborative process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7a76\u533b\u7597AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u76d1\u7ba1\u6307\u5357\u7684\u201c\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u201d\u4e0e\u201c\u600e\u4e48\u505a\u201d\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597AI\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u89c4\u4fa7\u91cd\u201c\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u201d\u800c\u975e\u201c\u600e\u4e48\u505a\u201d\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u4e09\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u533b\u7597AI\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4e09\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5171\u4eab\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6c9f\u901a\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u7597AI\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6c9f\u901a\u3002"}}

However, EAI systems introduce critical\nsecurity risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial\nperturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety\ndefinitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer\nsufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,\nhow to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in\nphysically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first\nsystematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded\nin ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled\ntaxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical\nconstraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;\n(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with\n2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)\nANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model\nthat decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our\nevaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates\nexceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and\nadaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical\nrobot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly\nconsequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent\nneed for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era.

This parametric approach yields a complete,\ncontinuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently\ninterpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in\noutput size compared to coordinate-based methods.
