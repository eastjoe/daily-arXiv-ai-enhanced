In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

More specifically, we study\ntwo prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from\nabstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the\nrespective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes\ncalled non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation\nframeworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the\nrelations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general\nnon-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been\nrecently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions\ncannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated\nfor ABA so far. We introduce strong admissibility for ABA and investigate\ndesirable properties. We furthermore extend the recent investigations of weak\nadmissibility in the flat ABA fragment to the non-flat case. We show that the\ncentral modularization property is maintained under classical, strong, and weak\nadmissibility.

As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world\nscenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of\nupdates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In\nthis paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for\nCKGE.

To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion\nArena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected\ndirectly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model\ncomparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect\npractical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the\nBradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,\na cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated\nmodels, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that\nprioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize\ninformation gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and\nsimulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable\nrankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced\ndatasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation.
