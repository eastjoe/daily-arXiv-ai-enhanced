Discussions of whether or how to integrate\nlarge language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,\nor interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of\nhow these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's\nalignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of\nLLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we\nelicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images\nthat were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that\nwhen performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human\nparticipants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or\nhigher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between\nhuman and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall\nLLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,\ndisgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)\norganization.

Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs", "comment": "Accepted at ICSR25", "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have\nopened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of\nautonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative\nreasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or\nknows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study\ninvestigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed\nsolution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the\nperformance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a\nstructured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct\ncategories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths\n(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative\nactions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''\nexamples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each\ndecision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and\noverall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are\nsuccessful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in\nscenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs\nof epistemic actions.

Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic\nand probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an\nadditional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process\nfollows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a\nguided way after an initial learning set is collected.
