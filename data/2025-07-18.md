Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

Conclusion: 本文综述了可解释强化学习（XRL）领域250多篇论文，提出了一种基于“是什么”和“如何”两个问题的直观分类法，并指出了XRL领域未来的研究方向。

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

Result: 证明了LMM能够根据RL代理的行为轨迹迭代改进游戏机制。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型(LMM)可以根据强化学习(RL)代理提供的行为轨迹迭代改进游戏机制，为AI辅助游戏设计提供实用且可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

Result: 白盒监控优于黑盒监控，但性能提升有限。

Conclusion: 现有检测AI助手欺骗行为的探测器效果有限，白盒监控略优于黑盒监控，但提升幅度不大。

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

Abstract: In recent years, peer learning has gained attention as a method that promotes
spontaneous thinking among learners, and its effectiveness has been confirmed
by numerous studies. This study aims to develop an AI Agent as a learning
companion that enables peer learning anytime and anywhere. However, peer
learning between humans has various limitations, and it is not always
effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency
levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same
proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper calls for a new AI evaluation framework focused on rapid adaptation via world model induction, using novel games as benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI world model evaluations are narrow, focusing on static representations instead of efficient learning through interaction.  This paper seeks to bridge this gap by drawing on cognitive science research on human adaptation.

Method: The method involves proposing a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully designed games with continually refreshing novelty, and using appropriate metrics to evaluate agents' ability for rapid world model induction.

Result: A new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI is proposed, emphasizing rapid world model induction and using novel games as benchmarks.

Conclusion: This perspective advocates for a new evaluation framework for adaptive world models in AI, focusing on rapid world model induction and proposing a benchmarking paradigm using novel games.

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI时代，依靠人工判断来评估海量模拟场景中的伦理后果既低效又不可行。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于多准则决策方法，利用熵的概念来自动计算伦理属性的权重，从而在基于模拟的测试和评估过程中动态地权衡伦理决策。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种将人类判断从AI模拟决策循环中移除的方法，该方法允许AI探索大量场景中的伦理影响，并最终为人类指挥官提供少量可选项以供选择。

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

Conclusion: 本文首次提出了一种将操纵风险纳入 AI 安全治理的系统方法，为 AI 公司评估和降低这些风险提供了一个具体的框架。

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

### [12] [VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885)
*Jian Yao,Ran Cheng,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 强化学习提升LLM数学推理能力可能只是过拟合，VAR-MATH框架验证了这一点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在数学推理基准测试中取得的进展可能并非真正的推理能力提升，而是过拟合的结果。

Method: 提出VAR-MATH符号评估框架，通过将数值问题转化为符号模板并要求模型求解多个实例，以增强评估的鲁棒性并减少数据泄漏的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，在VAR-MATH框架下，强化学习训练的模型性能大幅下降，尤其是在较小的模型上，这证实了之前的担忧。

Conclusion: VAR-MATH框架揭示了强化学习训练的语言模型在数学推理方面存在严重的过拟合问题，其性能在面对变化的数值问题时大幅下降，表明这些模型依赖于表面启发式而非真正的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

### [13] [A Translation of Probabilistic Event Calculus into Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12989)
*Lyris Xu,Fabio Aurelio D'Asaro,Luke Dickens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Combines Probabilistic Event Calculus with Markov Decision Processes for goal-directed reasoning in uncertain environments, enhancing planning capabilities while preserving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEC lacks mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper aims to bridge this gap by leveraging the strengths of MDPs for planning and decision-making within the PEC framework.

Method: The paper develops a formal translation from PEC domains to MDPs, introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's flexible action semantics.  It also details methods for mapping learned MDP policies back into human-readable PEC representations.

Result: The resulting PEC-MDP formalism allows applying MDP algorithms and tools to PEC domains, supporting both temporal reasoning and objective-driven planning while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: This paper introduces PEC-MDP, a formalism that combines Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) with Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), enabling goal-directed reasoning within PEC's interpretable narrative framework.

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

Motivation: 为了响应对可信赖 AI 的需求，本文提出了一种针对 MILP 解的对比解释方法。

Method: X-MILP 使用约束推理技术，将用户查询编码为附加约束，然后计算 IIS 来确定构成答案的原因，最后以原因图的形式呈现解释。

Result: 在已知优化问题的实例上测试了该方法，评估了计算解释的经验难度。

Conclusion: X-MILP 是一种用于构建 MILP 对比解释的领域无关方法，该方法基于约束推理技术，通过计算不可约不可行子系统 (IIS) 并将其表示为“原因图”来回答用户关于 MILP 解的查询。

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.
