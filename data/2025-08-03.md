Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一个统一框架，改进KGC事后解释的评估协议，强调了解释的可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识图谱补全（KGC）的事后可解释性缺乏形式化和一致的评估，阻碍了可重复性和跨研究比较。

Method: 提出了一种通用的多目标优化框架来描述KGC中的事后解释，并建议改进的评估协议。

Result: 提出了一种统一的框架和改进的评估协议，以提高KGC可解释性的可重复性和影响力。

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在通过统一方法和改进评估标准，使知识图谱补全的可解释性研究更具可重复性和影响力。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework assesses scientific data readiness for AI training, focusing on challenges and solutions for large-scale, HPC-based AI in science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models, and to guide infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for scalable and reproducible AI for science.

Method: The paper analyzes archetypal workflows across four domains (climate, nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials) to identify common preprocessing patterns and domain-specific constraints.  A two-dimensional readiness framework (Data Readiness Levels and Data Processing Stages) tailored to HPC environments is introduced.

Result: A two-dimensional readiness framework characterizing scientific data readiness and a conceptual maturity matrix are presented.

Conclusion: This paper proposes a two-dimensional framework for assessing the readiness of scientific data for AI training, addressing challenges in transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, particularly for transformer-based generative models.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

### [3] [FairReason: Balancing Reasoning and Social Bias in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23067)
*Zhenyu Pan,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haoran Lu,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现强化学习方法可以有效平衡MLLMs的公平性和能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)的推理能力和偏差之间的权衡，寻求在提高推理能力的同时减轻社会偏差。

Method: 基准测试三种偏差缓解策略：监督微调(SFT)、知识蒸馏(KD)和基于规则的强化学习(RL)，并改变每种策略中去偏差和推理样本的比例。

Result: 发现1:4的强化学习训练样本比例在减少刻板印象得分和保持推理准确性之间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 这项研究基准测试了三种偏差缓解策略，并在强化学习中发现了推理能力和偏差之间最佳的平衡点，即1:4的去偏差和推理样本比例，可减少刻板印象得分10%，同时保留88%的推理准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

### [4] [Moravec's Paradox: Towards an Auditory Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23091)
*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI在听觉任务上远逊于人类，失败率超过93%，需改进选择性注意、物理声学理解和上下文感知等能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在听觉任务上的失败，以及对Moravec悖论的启发。

Method: 设计了一个包含七个类别的917个挑战的听觉图灵测试，评估了包括GPT-4和Whisper在内的最先进音频模型。

Result: 最先进的音频模型的失败率超过93%，即使表现最好的模型准确率也仅为6.9%，远低于人类的52%。这表明AI系统缺乏人类般的听觉场景分析机制。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统在人类轻松完成的听觉任务上存在严重缺陷，该研究通过一个包含917个挑战的听觉图灵测试评估了最先进的音频模型，结果表明其失败率超过93%，这揭示了AI系统在处理复杂听觉场景中的不足，尤其是在选择性注意、噪声鲁棒性和上下文适应方面。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

### [5] [Argumentatively Coherent Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23163)
*Deniz Gorur,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论证一致性提高预测准确性，但需改进用户认知和系统过滤机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究论证结构中预测的特性，特别是论证一致性对预测准确性的影响。

Method: 评估论证一致性对人类和大型语言模型预测准确性的影响，并通过众包用户实验检验用户对一致性的认知。

Result: 过滤不一致预测可提高预测准确性，但用户通常无法识别一致性。

Conclusion: 增强论证一致性可提高人类和大型语言模型的预测准确性，但用户通常不认同这种一致性，因此需要在基于论证的判断预测中加入过滤机制。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

### [6] [Tractable Responsibility Measures for Ontology-Mediated Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23191)
*Meghyn Bienvenu,Diego Figueira,Pierre Lafourcade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究本体介导查询应答中责任分数计算的复杂性，发现某些情况下是多项式复杂度，某些情况下是难解的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化解释查询答案的责任分数的计算复杂性问题。

Method: 研究了基于加权最小支持的Shapley值责任度量在本体介导查询应答中的复杂性。利用数据库设置的结果，分析了不同本体语言和查询类下的数据复杂度和组合复杂度。

Result: 确定了在本体介导查询应答中计算基于加权最小支持的Shapley值责任度量的复杂性边界，指出了易处理和难解的查询类。

Conclusion: 研究了本体介导查询应答中计算责任分数的复杂性，发现基于加权最小支持的Shapley值责任度量在可重写的一阶查询类中具有多项式数据复杂度，但在本体语言可以编码可达性查询时则为'shP'-hard。进一步研究了其组合复杂度，发现即使在没有本体的情况下，如果本体语言支持合取，则原子查询和良性合取查询的并集也是难解的。最后，研究者确定了在常见的DL-Lite方言中，结构受限的合取查询允许易处理的WSMS计算。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

### [7] [Solution-aware vs global ReLU selection: partial MILP strikes back for DNN verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23197)
*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种高效的深度学习模型验证方法，通过改进的评分和分支策略以及混合MILP求解器，显著提高了验证效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理复杂实例的验证问题，寻求更高效准确的验证方法。

Method: 采用分治法，结合解决方案感知ReLU评分（SAS）和改进的BaB-SR、BaB-FSB分支函数，以及Hybrid MILP方法。

Result: SAS方法将二元变量数量减少了约6倍，同时保持相同的准确性；Hybrid MILP方法将未确定实例的数量减少了高达40%，平均运行时间为46s-417s。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的解决方案感知ReLU评分（SAS）方法，并改进了BaB-SR和BaB-FSB分支函数作为全局ReLU评分（GS）函数，有效减少了二元变量数量，提高了效率和准确性。结合Hybrid MILP方法，该方法显著减少了未确定实例的数量，并在合理的时间内验证了大型CNN模型。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) is propelling automated
scientific discovery to the next level, with LLM-based Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Scientist systems now taking the lead in scientific research. Several
influential works have already appeared in the field of AI Scientist systems,
with AI-generated research papers having been accepted at the ICLR 2025

phenomena previously unknown to humans, may soon become a reality. In this
survey, we focus on the central question: How far are AI scientists from
changing the world and reshaping the scientific research paradigm? To answer
this question, we provide a prospect-driven review that comprehensively
analyzes the current achievements of AI Scientist systems, identifying key
bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a
scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve
grand challenges. We hope this survey will contribute to a clearer
understanding of limitations of current AI Scientist systems, showing where we
are, what is missing, and what the ultimate goals for scientific AI should be.

Motivation: 识别自主AI的风险，特别是随着人工超级智能的临近

Method: 对自主AI的三个级别进行识别和分析，并提出12个论据和6个反驳论据及其反驳

Result: 主张AI不应完全自主，应有人类监管

Conclusion: AI不应完全自主，应有人类监管以降低风险

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation
for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

Motivation: 现有的自动合成范式在确保合成指令的多样性和难度方面仍存在局限性，本文旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为Self-Foveate的LLM驱动指令合成方法，该方法采用“微分散-宏观”多级注视机制，引导LLM深入挖掘非监督文本中细粒度信息。

Result: 实验证明Self-Foveate方法有效且优于现有方法，数据和代码已公开发布。

Conclusion: Self-Foveate方法有效提高了指令合成的多样性和难度，并在多个非监督语料库和不同的模型架构上验证了其有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

TL;DR: 推理模型+精心设计的上下文管道=因果发现的显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究最先进的推理模型在因果发现任务中的鲁棒性，该任务对传统模型具有挑战性。

Method: 使用Corr2Cause基准测试OpenAI的o系列和DeepSeek-R模型，并引入了一种基于Tree-of-Thoughts和Chain-of-Thoughts方法的模块化上下文管道。

Result: 推理优先架构比以往方法取得了显著更大的原生收益，模块化上下文管道使性能提升近三倍。

Conclusion: 先进的推理模型在因果发现方面取得了重大进展，但精心构建的上下文框架对于最大限度地发挥其能力至关重要。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Motivation: 现有的图像分类器解释算法缺乏形式上的严格性，而基于逻辑的解释方法则依赖于对模型的严格假设，这些假设在图像分类器中并不成立。

Method: 提出了一种基于因果关系的图像分类器解释方法，该方法无需了解模型内部结构，也不需要梯度信息或模型的单调性等性质。

Result: 实现了因果解释的定义，并通过实验验证了算法的有效性和效率。平均每张图像计算所有类型的解释需要6秒。

Conclusion: 本文证明了因果解释在形式上与逻辑解释具有相同的特性，同时适用于黑盒算法，并适合图像分类器。引入了对比因果解释和完整因果解释的概念，并通过实验验证了不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性方面的不同模式。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Motivation: 现有的基于大型语言模型的智能体在上下文学习的有效性高度依赖于演示的选择，次优的例子往往导致性能不稳定或下降。现有方法通常依赖于启发式或特定于任务的设计，缺乏一个通用的、理论上有根据的标准来判断哪些演示在推理步骤中有效。

Method: 提出了一种基于因果关系的演示选择方法DICE，该方法将演示知识分解为可转移和不可转移成分，并提出了一种逐步选择标准。

Result: DICE方法在多个领域取得了有效的实验结果，证明了其有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为DICE的理论框架，用于在大型语言模型代理的推理过程中选择最相关的演示，从而提高其性能。DICE通过因果关系将演示知识分解为可转移和不可转移的成分，并提出了一种逐步选择标准，具有改进代理性能的正式保证。实验结果表明，DICE方法有效且通用。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.
